Hello again everyone! Did you miss me? üòÖ

Last week I returned from four months of parental leave, spending as much time as possible with our second boy, Miles.

When I first stepped away, I didn‚Äôt realize how burned out I was. It took almost three months of rest before I felt "normal" again - something I didn‚Äôt even notice until I was on the other side of it.

To avoid falling into that same trap, I‚Äôm limiting my client work for the rest of the year. I‚Äôll only be taking on a few projects so I can focus on my personal health, my family, and my book.

## Turbo Native is dead, long live Hotwire Native!

As you might have heard by now - Turbo Native is officially being retired in favor of [Hotwire Native](https://dev.37signals.com/announcing-hotwire-native/). This transition marks a major evolution for mobile development with Hotwire, making it *even easier* for Rails developers to build native iOS and Android apps.

And I had the privilege of building the iOS library with the talented team at 37signals.

Hotwire Native combines Turbo Native and Strada into a single, all-encompassing package. Strada components have been renamed to ‚Äúbridge components‚Äù and come configured out of the box. Some high-level APIs have also been reworked to make getting started faster than ever.

My [TurboNavigator](https://github.com/joemasilotti/TurboNavigator) library, for example, is now the default way of navigating between screens on iOS. This means you can pop between native and web with just a few lines of code.

We also took the time to clean up the official documentation, which now lives at [native.hotwired.dev](https://native.hotwired.dev/). This includes examples and references for getting started, creating bridge components, navigating to native screens, and more.

I‚Äôm planning on doing a *Hotwire Native in 15 minutes* video soon. Anything specific you‚Äôd like to see me cover? [Send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) and let me know.

## Book updates

I can finally reveal the super secret *actual* title of my book: [Hotwire Native for Rails Developers]({% link _pages/book.liquid %})!

Chapters 1-3 have gone through their first round of editor reviews and the first draft of chapter 4 is already complete. I‚Äôm moving at a good pace and I‚Äôm happy to say that a public beta is expected in the next few months.

You‚Äôll be able to buy the beta at a discounted price on [The Pragmatic Bookshelf‚Äôs Beta page](https://pragprog.com/categories/beta/). The beta will include the first five chapters, giving you a solid foundation to start building Hotwire Native apps:

1. Build Your First Hotwire Native Apps
2. Control Your Apps with Rails
3. Navigate Gracefully with Path Configuration
4. Add a Native Tab Bar
5. Build Native Screens with SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose

I‚Äôm excited to be back and focusing on my book again. Don‚Äôt hesitate to send me an [email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) if you have any Hotwire Native questions - talk soon!
