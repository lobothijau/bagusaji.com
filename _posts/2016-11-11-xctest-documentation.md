Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later. Apple has officially sent me a [cease and desist letter](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2016/2016-11-10-Apple.md) to take down my host of the XCTest Documentation.

But that's OK! I was only hosting the docs because Apple wasn't doing it themselves. To be honest, I expected this day to come sooner.

Earlier this year Apple updated their API Reference and finally added **official** XCTest support. [Apple's XCTest documentation](https://developer.apple.com/reference/xctest) is available alongside their other API References.

To all of those that linked here, thank you! I hope it helped get your XCUITest suite up and running.
