Earlier this month I spoke on the [SwiftCoders podcast](http://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/25-joe-masilotti-lead-developer-at-beermenus) with the host, [Garric Nahapetian](https://twitter.com/garricn). We talked about getting started in Swift, how I went from a job at a big bank to the being the lead developer for BeerMenus, and, obviously, testing.

If you have a few minutes go have a listen. And make sure to check out the other episodes. The podcast has an awesome cast of interviewees, such as [Josh Brown](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/24-josh-brown-indie-ios-dev-and-content-publisher/) (Parsing JSON in Swift), [Dominik Hauser](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/11-dominik-hauser-author-of-tdd-in-swift-swiftandpainlesscom/) (TDD in Swift and SwiftAndPainless.com), and [Ash Furrow](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/ash-furrow/) (Artsy and Coocapods).
