I’m leaving Twitter for a bit.

The site has become increasingly triggering to me. Controversial takes are one thing but I feel like my feed is purposely pressing my buttons these days.

I get it. Enragement = engagement. But I think it has gone too far.

And it is taking a toll on my mental health.

I took a break from Twitter this weekend. Two entire days!

And my step has felt a little lighter. My thoughts a little brighter.

Do I still think about tweeting? All freaking day.

But it feels nice to ignore those for a little while. And to focus on the present.

I’m taking a break and I don’t know when I’ll be back. It might be a week. It might be a year.

I’m not returning until I know that opening the app will make me feel *better*. Not worse.

I still want to stay in touch with the friends I’ve made over the years. So I’m starting a weekly-ish newsletter on Turbo Native, growing RailsDevs, and being a solopreneur.

If newsletters aren't your thing or you just want to chat then please [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com). I still genuinely enjoy it and I respond to everyone.
