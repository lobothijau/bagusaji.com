Last week I spoke on the [Concepts in Code podcast](http://podcast.conceptsincode.com). The cohosts, [Hank Turowski](https://twitter.com/HankTurowski) and [BJ Miller](https://twitter.com/bjmillerltd), were kind enough to let me ramble about testing. We also got into some ideas for pair programming.

If you have a few minutes go have a listen. And make sure to check out their other episodes. They are building a [Package Tracker app](https://github.com/ConceptsInCode/PackageTracker) from scratch and documenting their progress, live!
