Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter!

I planned on recapping 2023 but there‚Äôs so much good content I decided to do a full edition instead. This month we have a big announcement around Rails 8, a free crash course on Hotwire, and *two* new Turbo Native apps in the App Store.

And one of those apps is mine. üòä With the power of Ruby on Rails and Turbo Native I launched a web and iOS app to the App Store in just *7 days*. And the best part? **It‚Äôs open source!** Check out the Turbo Native section below for a breakdown of the app and a video where I dive into the hand-rolled authentication.

Until next month folks. Happy New Year!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Turbo and Stimulus

### [Turbo 8 morphing deep dive - how does it work?](https://radanskoric.com/articles/turbo-morphing-deep-dive)

by Radan Skoriƒá

This detailed teardown covers the internals of morphing in Turbo 8, complete with diagrams, code snippets, and their relations to existing Hotwire paradigms. [Part 2](https://radanskoric.com/articles/turbo-morphing-deep-dive-idiomorph) is dedicated to the idiomorph algorithm and includes an interactive demo to really tie things together.

### [How did we go from AJAX to Turbolinks to Hotwire? A brief web history](https://buttondown.email/bhumi/archive/how-did-we-go-from-ajax-to-turbolinks-to-hotwire/)

by Bhumi [@bhumi1102](https://twitter.com/bhumi1102/)

Ah, a trip down memory lane. Bhumi takes us back 10+ years in web history, starting with AJAX and RailsUJS, then the JavaScript vs. HTML divide, and finally looking ahead at the future: morphing with Turbo 8.

### üé• [Turbo 8 Morphing in real life](https://superails.com/posts/rails-156-turbo-8-morphing-in-real-life)

by Yaroslav Shmarov [@yarotheslav](https://twitter.com/yarotheslav)

In this cast, Yaro demos some traditional Turbo Stream code and then explains how to install Turbo 8 to migrate the code to use morphing. The second half showcases using Turbo 8 in a real application along with some pitfalls and gotchas you should be aware of.

### üé• [Hotkeys](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/hotkeys)

by David Kimura [@kobaltz](https://twitter.com/kobaltz)

This video tutorial covers how to integrate keyboard shortcuts in your Rails app via a Stimulus controller. The implementation wraps the `stimulus-hotkeys` library and demos it with a visual keyboard on screen, highlighting each key as it is pressed.

## üì≤ Turbo Native

### [1500cals in the iOS App Store!](https://mileswoodroffe.com/articles/1500cals-app-store)

by Miles Woodroffe [@tapster](https://twitter.com/tapster)

Miles achieved his New Years resolution and published an app to the App Store! üéâ 1500cals is a Ruby on Rails + Turbo Native app that helped Miles lose 50kg last year. The app helps plan meals and track exercise by reading data directly from Apple Health.

### [Idea to App Store in 7 days]({% post_url 2023-12-14-idea-to-app-store-in-7-days %})

by Joe Masilotti (me!) [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Last week I started a new project to scratch an itch. Something simple but useful. And in just¬†*7 days*¬†I launched a web and iOS app to the App Store. This is the story of¬†[Daily Log](https://dailylog.ing/), an open source Turbo Native app.

### **[Daily Log code deep dive - Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrefcZzD3kE)**

by Joe Masilotti (me!) [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

The first in a series of videos diving into the source code of [Daily Log](https://dailylog.ing/), my open source Rails + Turbo Native app. This one covers *authentication* - a single controller concern for user registration and session management. Stick around for the second half where I highlight how it works in Turbo Native.

### **[Use Turbo Native to make hybrid apps that don't suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4g_raRF-cE)**

Ayush‚Äôs talk from Friendly.rb is live on YouTube along with the [rest of the talks](https://www.youtube.com/@Friendlyrb/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0) from the conference. He provides a high-level overview of what hybrid apps are and why they get such a bad rap. There‚Äôs also a section on interacting with the JavaScript bridge, the same API that Strada uses under the hood.
