edition: June 2022 edition
---

It‚Äôs been an entire _year_ since the first edition of the newsletter went out last June! I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve grown from 200 to almost 2000 Hotwire developers in only a year.

To celebrate, I‚Äôve recapped the most popular articles of the past year. But first, let‚Äôs see what the Hotwire community has been up to.

First up, [Rails](https://discord.gg/bWTasVEZ) and [Hotwire](https://discord.gg/y6qef6yu) have their own official Discord channels! They are geared towards helping contributors and not general support forums. But if you're interested in contributing I recommend joining and saying hi.

by Cezar Halmagean (Mix & Go) [@chalmagean](https://twitter.com/chalmagean)

A great concept because it's so easy to picture in our heads: a calculator. This tutorial codes all of the math logic in Ruby and steps back as Hotwire updates the HTML.

## üéì Tutorials and guides

### [A11y on Rails](http://www.a11yonrails.com)

by Monica Mateiu [@a11yonrails](https://twitter.com/a11yonrails)

A deep dive into some changes you can apply to your Rails app to improve a11y (accessibility). My favorite, and new to me, is adding `aria-live="polite"` to flash messages so assistive technology can announce them correctly.

### [Tailwind style CSS transitions with StimulusJS](https://boringrails.com/articles/tailwind-style-css-transitions-with-stimulusjs/)

by Matt Swanson [@\_swanson](https://twitter.com/_swanson)

Matt levels up our UI designs by adding smooth animations to transition elements. Classic example? Showing and hiding a menu. This is a great place to start if you use Tailwind UI, too!

### [Building a chat with Hanami and Hotwire](https://katafrakt.me/2022/06/15/building-chat-hanami-hotwire/)

by Pawe≈Ç ≈öwiƒÖtkowski [@katafrakt_pl](https://twitter.com/katafrakt_pl)

I share a lot of Rails content in this newsletter. So I'm excited to give our friends working with [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org) some love! Follow along as Pawe≈Ç builds a chat app from scratch, including a link to the full source code.

## üìà Most popular links from the last year

### [Hotwire Handbook](https://philreynolds.dev/posts/2022/hotwire-handbook-part-1)

by Phil Reynolds [@PurpleRiver_Dev](https://twitter.com/PurpleRiver_Dev)

A living document on practical examples and how to accomplish them with Hotwire. So far, toggle buttons, content updates, and live counters are covered. Upcoming features include pagination, inline editing, and (what I‚Äôm looking forward to the most) tabbed content. And [Part 2](https://philreynolds.dev/posts/2022/hotwire-handbook-part-2) dropped a few days ago!

### [Hotwire in the real world.](https://finnian.io/blog/hotwire-in-the-real-world/)

by Finnian Anderson [@developius](https://twitter.com/developius)

A deep dive into the architecture decisions, pitfalls, and wins of using Hotwire in non-trivial production application. I especially love the section on how important authorization is with Turbo Streams. Finnian recommends using [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) and covers how they are using it in their app.

### [Hotwire::Livereload](https://github.com/kirillplatonov/hotwire-livereload)

by irill Platonov [@kirplatonov](https://twitter.com/kirplatonov)

Automatically reload the page when ‚Äúview‚Äù files are modified, like HTML, CSS, helpers, and JavaScript. Can also be configured to listen to any path, like view components.

### [The Stimulus Trigger Pattern](https://jose.omg.lol/posts/stimulus-trigger-pattern/)

by Jose Farias [@fariastweets](https://twitter.com/fariastweets)

A pragmatic and practical approach to a common problem with Hotwire: how do I submit a HTTP request after a Turbo Stream is rendered? Jose walks through how they built a shared space for two entities to communicate with each other, powered by Hotwire and some Liquid templating.

### [User notifications with Rails, Noticed, and Hotwire](https://www.colby.so/posts/user-notifications-with-rails-noticed-and-hotwire)

by David Colby [@davidcolbyatx](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)

This tutorial starts with an empty Rails 7 project then adds on a Turbo Frame, creates a Noticed notification, wires up ActionCable, and finally subscribes to the stream via Hotwire. It‚Äôs everything you need to set up a live-updating notification drawer in your Rails app.
