edition: August 2021 edition

Welcome back to the ⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter! This edition has a lot of great tutorials along with a full-featured book on Rails development. I'm extra excited about the first two links: building a Twitter clone and HEY-inspired pop-ups.

You'll also notice a new section, Jobs. This includes both employers looking to hire Rails devs and individuals who are looking for Rails work. If you're on either end of the market, [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) to get added to the next edition.

## 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫 Tutorials

### [How to build a Twitter clone with Rails and Hotwire](https://robrace.dev/build-a-twitter-clone-with-rails-hotwire/)

by Rob Race [@rob__race](https://twitter.com/rob__race)

Rob walks through building a Twitter clone that live-updates thanks to Action Cable with no custom JavaScript. And the best part? You can get yours working in less than 10 minutes.

### [HEY-inspired Pop-ups Using Hotwire](https://dev.to/jacobdaddario/hey-style-pop-ups-using-turbo-14p7)

by Jacob Daddario [@JacobDaddario](https://twitter.com/JacobDaddario)

Replicate Hey and Basecamp’s pop-up menus with a Turbo Frame and a tiny Stimulus controller. This approach works great for menus because the content is only loaded when toggled and will remain cached.

### [Handling modal forms with Rails, Tailwind CSS, and Hotwire](https://www.colby.so/posts/handling-modal-forms-with-rails-and-hotwire)

by David Colby [@davidcolbyatx](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)

Not just remotely rendered modals, but _forms_ inside of said modals. Extends the modal controller from [TailwindCSS Stimulus Components](https://github.com/excid3/tailwindcss-stimulus-components) to hook into success and failure callbacks to clear errors.

### [Lazy load data with minimum effort](https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/using_hotwire_to_lazy_load_data/)

by John Kapantzakis [@kapantzak](https://twitter.com/kapantzak)

A before-and-after article showing how to lazy load content with vanilla JavaScript then converting it to a Turbo Frame. The diff? 20 lines added and 65 removed!
