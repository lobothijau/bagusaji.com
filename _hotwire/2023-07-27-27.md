Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter!

There is a lot of exciting content this month. Highlights include the Rails World speaker announcement, a bunch of Hotwire tutorials, and some articles on integrating native code into Turbo Native apps.

I‚Äôve also officially started writing [my book](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1682440004570857473)! It will help Rails developers with zero iOS knowledge build fully functioning Turbo Native apps. I barely have one chapter done but I am **pumped** to work on this. üí™

If you want a look behind the scenes then subscribe to my [weekly newsletter]({% link _pages/newsletter.liquid %}). I‚Äôm posting snippets and content sneak peeks as I write.

## üì∞ News

### [Rails World speakers announcement](https://rubyonrails.org/world/speakers)

29 speakers have been announced for the [Rails World conference](https://rubyonrails.org/world) in October and _wow_ is this an impressive list. ü§© There‚Äôs a lot of familiar faces in the Rails community and a few pleasant surprises. I wonder what the creator of Tailwind, [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1683538550518689792), will be talking about!

You'll also notice that my name is on the list. I‚Äôm finally presenting a talk on Turbo Native! And I‚Äôm honored to have my name next to such distinguished folks. I hope to see you there.

## üë©‚Äçüéì Tutorials

### [What is the difference between Turbo and Stimulus, and what exactly is Hotwire?](https://www.ducktypelabs.com/turbo-vs-stimulus/)

by Sid Krishnan

I like kicking off each newsletter with an introductory article. And this week is no exception.

Sid provides an overview of Hotwire and how all the different pieces fit together. There‚Äôs also a little code snippet on how one could naively implement Turbo(links). Even after years of working with the framework it‚Äôs nice to see it boiled down to just a few lines of code.

### [Broadcasting Progress from Background Jobs](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/broadcasting-progress-from-background-jobs)

by David Kimura [@kobaltz](https://twitter.com/kobaltz)

Learn how to broadcast a Turbo Stream from a background job to update a visual progress bar. And stick around for the second half where David explores a Stimulus controller to coordinate updates from multiple jobs running at the same time.

### [Simple Lazy Loading in Rails with Hotwire and Turbo Frames](https://railsnotes.xyz/blog/simple-lazy-loading-hotwire-turbo-frames-rails)

by Harrison Broadbent [@hrrsnbbnt](https://twitter.com/hrrsnbbnt?lang=en)

Loading content asynchronously has become much easier in Rails with the introduction of Turbo Frames. Follow along as Harrison teaches you everything you need to know, including an animated loader powered by Tailwind CSS.

### [Craft a Custom Context Menu in Rails 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39M7GHzZsG4)

by Deanin [@Deaniocom](https://twitter.com/deaniocom)

Ever wondered how your email client shows something custom when you right-click? This tutorial walks you through how to add one to your Rails app. It wires up a Stimulus controller to render a HTML partial - leaving you the flexibility to style it to match your app. üñ±Ô∏è

### [Supercharge your Stimulus controllers with Custom APIs](https://marcoroth.dev/posts/supercharge-your-stimulus-controllers-with-custom-apis)

by Marco Roth [@marcoroth_](https://twitter.com/marcoroth_)

Ever wished you could access DOM elements by CSS selectors in Stimulus? This tutorial shows you how to do just that - by building your own custom API, right into Stimulus!

The best part is that the technique can be reused to build more of your own customizations. The possibilities are endless.

### [Liking Posts With Hotwire in Ruby on Rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcjWe_Sc_Ck)

by Chris Oliver [@excid3](https://twitter.com/excid3)

Back in 2014 GoRails published [Liking Posts](https://gorails.com/episodes/liking-posts), a video tutorial showing how to update a *like* count without reloading the entire page. As expected back then, Chris used jQuery and `.js.erb` template files.

This tutorial rebuilds the same functionality with a modern approach, Turbo Streams. It‚Äôs great to recognize just how far the Rails frontend has come with the introduction of Hotwire.

### [Active Storage Turbo Persistence Across Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3zboEkzQ3Q)

by Deanin [@Deaniocom](https://twitter.com/deaniocom)

Another dive into _permanent_ elements from Dean. Learn how to keep progress of an embedded YouTube video even when clicking between pages. As always, there are a bunch of tiny gotchas to watch out for - with solutions to each in the video.

## üêô Open source projects

### [The Ultimate Turbo Modal for Rails (UTMR)](https://github.com/cmer/ultimate-turbo-modal)

by Carl Mercier

A "featureful, yet extremely easy to use" modal implementation built for Turbo-powered Rails apps. There‚Äôs a huge feature list in the README but I‚Äôm most excited about two things: opening a modal updates the browser‚Äôs URL and modals opened in a new tab don‚Äôt break.

## üì± Turbo Native

### [Dynamic UIMenu in Turbo Native apps]({% post_url 2023-07-24-uimenu-turbo-native %})

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Learn how to markup existing HTML to render native components in a Turbo Native app.

I walk through using a native `UIMenu` in place of a web-powered hamburger menu. All made possible by a small Stimulus controller to send JavaScript messages over the bridge.

### [Add browser cache store PR](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/pull/949)

by Alberto Fern√°ndez-Capel

Currently, this (open) PR enables page snapshots to be persisted across different tabs, page reloads and even browser restarts. But I‚Äôm most excited because it ‚Äúis also a stepping stone to implement offline support with Service Workers.‚Äù

This could be the first step towards offline Turbo Native apps!

### [Turbo Native Authentication](https://williamkennedy.ninja/turbo/2023/07/02/turbo-native-auth-rails/)

by William Kennedy [@\_williamkennedy](https://twitter.com/_williamkennedy)

Split across three articles, William tackles native authentication in Turbo Native. He starts off with the [Rails backend](https://williamkennedy.ninja/turbo/2023/07/02/turbo-native-auth-rails/), following up with [iOS](https://williamkennedy.ninja/turbo/2023/07/03/turbo-native-auth-ios/) and finally [Android](https://williamkennedy.ninja/turbo/2023/07/17/turbo-native-auth-android/).

A fair warning that there is a _lot_ going on in this series. But it offers a solid starting point if you are looking to understand more of the native ‚Üî web interaction that Turbo Native offers.
