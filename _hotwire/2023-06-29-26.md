Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! Wild to think I‚Äôve been running this for over two years now. The [first edition]({% link _hotwire/2021-06-22-1.md %}) feels like just yesterday. ü•≤

Last week, tickets to Rails World were released and [all 650 sold out in 45 minutes](https://world.hey.com/dhh/rails-world-sold-out-less-than-45-minutes-78a0b276). I‚Äôm still waiting to hear if my talk was accepted so I didn‚Äôt try to get a ticket yet. But congratulations to everyone who managed to snag one ‚Äì hopefully I will see you in October.

What gets me most excited about Rails World is that [Jay Ohms is finally presenting Strada](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-site/issues/33#issuecomment-1596127687)! This framework promises to bridge the gap to Turbo Native apps. And I can‚Äôt wait to see what the team has been cooking up for the past few years.

And if you want to learn about Turbo Native *before* October I‚Äôve got you covered. I‚Äôm running another workshop on July 18! Learn how to bring your Ruby on Rails app to iOS in this 3-hour interactive workshop on Turbo Native. Tickets are limited to 20 attendees and went on sale this morning.

## Turbo Frames and Streams

### [Learn Hotwire by building the simplest possible Hotwire and Ruby on Rails app ‚Äî a beginners guide](https://railsnotes.xyz/blog/the-simplest-ruby-on-rails-and-hotwire-app-possible-beginners-guide)

by Harrison Broadbent [@hrrsnbbnt](https://twitter.com/hrrsnbbnt)

We‚Äôre going back to basics with this tutorial. This is a great place to start if you are still wrapping your head around what exactly Hotwire **is**. Harrison walks through everything you need to get a new Rails app working with a live-updating Turbo Stream.

There‚Äôs also a section at the bottom for more advanced streaming: sending updates only to a specific user.

### [Hotwire use case with sample code](https://hotwiredcases.dev)

by Moses Gathuku [@Gathukumose](https://twitter.com/Gathukumose)

Blog posts are great but you usually need to build the *entire* thing yourself before you can play with it. This new site from Moses flips that - giving you a demo to play with first. And the code second.

There are already Hotwire examples for inline editing, modals, typeahead search, and lazy loading. And more are expected to launch soon.

### [Maintaining State with Turbo Frames in Ruby on Rails 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60wMhP7V1Po)

by Deanin [@Deaniocom](https://twitter.com/deaniocom)

To persist elements between page loads you can add `data-turbo-permanent`. For example, to maintain the number of items a user has added to their shopping cart even when they navigate *back*.

But I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôve always struggled to use this attribute. And now I know why. Turns out there are a ton of gotchas you need to be aware of! Lucky for us, this video covers them all.

### [Pagy Gem with Turbo for Easy Infinite Scrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nrmf5KfD8Y)

by Deanin [@Deaniocom](https://twitter.com/deaniocom)

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve linked to a pagination tutorial but it does feel like the most straightforward. The ‚Äúmagic‚Äù is telling Pagy to load the next page via a Turbo Stream, not HTML. With a stream we can leverage the power of Turbo without writing any additional infrastructure or JavaScript.

## Stimulus

### [Practical Stimulus: Capture User Input](https://www.akshaykhot.com/practical-stimulus-capture-user-input/)

by Akshay Khot

The first article in a new series on Stimulus, this one starts with the basics. If you‚Äôve never worked with the framework before this is a great place to start. You build out the functionality with vanilla JavaScript before replacing it with a Stimulus controller, giving you a great side-by-side comparison of the two approaches.

### [Practical Stimulus: How to Toggle CSS Classes](https://www.akshaykhot.com/practical-stimulus-how-to-toggle-css-classes/)

by Akshay Khot

The first article in this series (linked above) covered the basic building blocks of Stimulus, `targets` and `actions`. This one goes a step farther and dives into the `classes` API. Which is useful for keeping CSS class names out of your JavaScript by only referencing them in your HTML.

### [Reactive Stimulus Values in Ruby on Rails 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAfAlxdhSHw)

by Deanin [@Deaniocom](https://twitter.com/deaniocom)

Continuing the trend of walking through the Stimulus API, this video covers `values`. Values read, write, and observe data attributes on a controller‚Äôs element. They are useful for passing information from the DOM to JavaScript.

## Turbo Native

### [Turbo Native in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83wOvrNtZX4)

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Learn how to get up and running with Turbo Native on iOS in 15 minutes. All you need to get started is a free copy of Xcode downloaded from the App Store.

I walk through adding the Swift package, wiring up a navigation controller, and handling link clicks. I also show how you can make your web content feel a little more at home on iOS.

### [3 Useful Tricks When Working With Turbo Android](https://williamkennedy.ninja/android/2023/06/02/3-useful-tricks-when-working-with-turbo-android/)

by William Kennedy [@\_williamkennedy](https://twitter.com/_williamkennedy)

William wraps up his [3-part series on Turbo Android](https://williamkennedy.ninja/android/2023/05/10/up-and-running-with-turbo-android-part-1/) with some tips on being a more effective native developer. He covers how to debug the web view, where to keep your business logic, and a clever trick to render Android-specific HTML from your server.

### [motion-turbo-ios](https://github.com/p8/motion-turbo-ios)

by Petrik de Heus [@four54](https://twitter.com/four54)

[RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com) enables cross-platform native apps for iOS, Android, and OS X, written in Ruby. And now you can leverage the power of Turbo Native to help render your Rails HTML content on iOS with motion-turbo-ios.

Disclaimer: I‚Äôve never used RubyMotion myself but it sounds promising!

### [JavaScript alerts in Turbo Native](https://masilotti.com/javascript-alerts-in-turbo-native/)

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Last week my client ran into an issue with their Turbo Native app. They couldn‚Äôt figure out why their Turbo confirmation dialog worked on mobile web but not in the app.

This quick tutorial explains how to handle `data-turbo-confirm` in your iOS app so you can render native Swift alerts directly from your Rails code.
