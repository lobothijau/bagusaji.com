Welcome back to the July edition of the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! This newsletter was sent to almost 2000 developers ‚Äì I appreciate each and every one of you. ü§ó

If you missed RailsConf this year now's your chance to catch up on the recordings. All [67 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHJudTY1K0f1WgIbKCc0_M-XMraWwCmk) have been uploaded to YouTube. Not sure where to start? I list my favorite talks below.

Speaking of YouTube, I‚Äôm doing my first [Turbo Native live stream](https://youtu.be/vgLIWVWAYrg) later today. And I‚Äôd love if you could come and say hi! I‚Äôll be fielding questions at the end if you have anything you‚Äôd like to ask.

We also have so much content from Matt Swanson he gets his own section this month. üòÜ

I wish this article existed when I was [building Mugshot Bot](https://masilotti.com/idea-to-sold-in-14-months/)!

## üë®‚Äçüíª The Matt Swanson section

Matt released so much quality content in the last few weeks that I couldn't decide what to cut. Instead of leaving anything out, here's everything!

### [The most underrated Rails helper: `dom_id`](https://boringrails.com/articles/rails-dom-id-the-most-underrated-helper/)

by Matt Swanson [@\_swanson](https://twitter.com/_swanson)

Even though `dom_id` has been around for over a decade, Hotwire breathes some new life into it. The helper generates HTML `id` values for Active Record models (and more) based on the ID and model name. Matt dives into using it for tag builders, deep linking anchor tags, and Turbo Frames + Streams.

### [Adding keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys to StimulusJS](https://boringrails.com/articles/stimulus-hotkeys-keyboard-shortcuts/)

by Matt Swanson [@\_swanson](https://twitter.com/_swanson)

Looking to add keyboard shortcuts to your Rails app but don‚Äôt know where to start? Matt reviews 4 different libraries and reasons why you would want to use one over the other. I'm hoping to adopt one of these soon for an upcoming feature I'm building.

### [Galaxy brain CSS tricks with Hotwire and Rails](https://boringrails.com/articles/css-tips-and-tricks-hotwire/)

One of the reasons I love the Code with Jason podcast is the tangents the interviews follow. This episode was particularly out there with Matt and Jason diving into their favorite books and pottery. Jason, if you‚Äôre reading this, I didn‚Äôt love the Foundation series either!

## üéñ Achievement unlocked!

I hit a big achievement last week: shortest time from project kick-off to live in the App Store. I ported a client‚Äôs Ruby on Rails app to iOS and we went live in the App Store in 7 short weeks. üéâ

This is a huge milestone because it gets me closer to my dream of helping more folks get their businesses on iOS. I [wrote about the process on my blog]({% post_url 2022-07-22-zero-to-app-store-in-7-weeks %}) diving into how it worked, the shortcuts we used, and how it all fit together.
