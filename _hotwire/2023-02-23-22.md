Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter!

This month we have an exciting announcement from The Rails Foundation, official Turbo support from Devise, and a bunch of updates about upcoming conferences.

And it‚Äôs exciting to see **two** Turbo Native articles make it into the newsletter this month! Even if one of them was written by me. üòÜ¬†Anyone else wish there was more content around this topic?

Speaking of, this month I‚Äôve been exploring a new approach to building iOS apps with Turbo Native. One that makes navigating between screens easier and more approachable for developers new to the framework.

The idea sparked from a call I had with a client. [My first _paid_ advisory call, too!](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1624067163719090178?s=20) üéâ They are comfortable building a Turbo Native MVP but can‚Äôt connect the dots between different navigation workflows.

I‚Äôm excited to see where I can take this approach and how changes can be potentially merged upstream to the framework itself.

## üì£ Announcements

### [Amanda Perino is our new executive director for The Rails Foundation](https://rubyonrails.org/2023/2/20/amanda-perino-is-our-executive-director)

Let‚Äôs all give [Amanda](https://twitter.com/AmandaBPerino) a warm welcome and congratulations as the new executive director of The Rails Foundation! Amanda will lead the mission to improve the documentation, education, marketing, and events in the Rails ecosystem.

The announcement also hints at news about the first official Rails conference from the organization. üëÄ

### [Devise v4.9.0 released with improved Turbo support](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/v4.9.0/CHANGELOG.md#490---2023-02-17)

After 1.5 years of workarounds, hacks, and monkey patching, Devise now officially supports Turbo out of the box. üéâ

To keep backwards compatibility, you can customize response status codes from Devise controllers. For compatibility with existing Hotwire apps, configure the following.

```ruby
# config/initializers/devise.rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  config.responder.error_status = :unprocessable_entity
  config.responder.redirect_status = :see_other
end
```

### [What's New in Rails 7.1](https://blog.appsignal.com/2023/02/15/whats-new-in-rails-7-1.html)

by Emmanuel Hayford [@siaw23](https://twitter.com/siaw23)

This dot release has a ton of features I‚Äôm excited about! My favorites: support for common table expressions removes some boiler plate when dealing with Arel queries, `stub_const` is now built in to `ActiveSupport::TestCase` and doesn‚Äôt require a third-party gem, and `#update_attribute!` (note the bang) because I usually want to call `#save!`.

I had the honor of being the first ever guest on the IndieRails podcast! Jeremy, Jess, and I talked about my first dev job, how getting let go kicked off my independent career, and how RailsDevs emerged.

### [Hotwiring Multi-Platform Rails Apps with Ayush Newatia](https://www.fullstackruby.dev/podcast/8/)

by Jared White [@jaredwhite](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite) and Ayush Newatia [@ayush](https://ruby.social/@ayush)

Fun fact: Ayush‚Äôs book, [The Rails & Hotwire Codex](https://railsandhotwirecodex.com), taught me about the [hidden native routes](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/blob/main/app/controllers/turbo/native/navigation.rb) built into the Hotwire Rails gem. Check out this episode to learn more about the book, Hotwire development, and why ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù is awesome.

### [Code and the Coding Coders who Code it - Episode #17](https://podcast.drbragg.dev/episodes/episode-17-joe-masilotti/)

by Drew Bragg [@DRBragg](https://twitter.com/DRBragg) and Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Drew and I dove into how I build in public, what it took to get RailsDevs off the ground, and how I combat burnout when I'm struggling to get stuff down.

## üì± Turbo Native

### [Bringing Card Table to the small screen](https://dev.37signals.com/bringing-card-table-to-the-small-screen/)

by Jirka Hut√°rek

The latest 37signals dev blog is all about mobile. Jirka breaks down how they migrated a Kanban board from desktop to small screens.

A screen like this requires high-fidelity interaction. So they went native first then filled in the gap for mobile web with an MVP-like implementation. Another great example of bringing a Rails app to iOS/Android with Turbo Native!

### [Progressively enhanced Turbo Native apps in the App Store](https://masilotti.com/progressively-enhanced-turbo-native-apps-in-the-app-store/)

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Here‚Äôs how 6 businesses are using Turbo Native to make high-fidelity mobile apps with native SDK integrations. Offline access, instant loading home screens, geofencing, and more. These apps tap into the power of the operating systems in ways that aren‚Äôt possible with ‚Äújust‚Äù a mobile website.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Tutorials

### [Advanced Turbo Streams in Hotwire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=cark5x17sTY&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

by Pete Hawkins [@peteyhawkins](https://twitter.com/peteyhawkins)

A quick and practical example of how to use a Turbo Stream to update content on a page asynchronously. Pete uses a checkout flow with a ‚Äúpayment processing‚Äù page to illustrate his point. After kicking off a background job (`sleep 3` üòÜ) the processing page automatically renders the success message, all without a redirect.

### [Create a drag and drop sortable list using Hotwire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKAMRLQpypk&t=2s)

by Pete Hawkins [@peteyhawkins](https://twitter.com/peteyhawkins)

Another five minute video from Pete, this time using Sortable.js and the `acts_as_list` gem to create a drag-and-drop list powered by Hotwire. The video includes the Stimulus controller to wire up the library as well as the Ruby code needed to receive and post updates to the database.

### [A quality of life Stimulus.js controller](https://dev.to/spinal/a-quality-of-life-stimulusjs-controller-391j)

by Spinal CMS [@SpinalCms](https://twitter.com/SpinalCms)

A little Stimulus controller that makes filling out repetitive forms a little less painful.

When running in development, it adds a button to the page when a form is found. When clicked it fills in number, email, and password fields with random data. Perfect for speeding up manual testing! üèéÔ∏è
