Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter!

I just got back from two weeks in Australia to watch the women‚Äôs World Cup. It was the first time my wife and I vacationed without our son since he was born. I almost forgot how much time there is in a day. üòÜ

Most of my time was spent visiting museums, drinking coffee at local caf√©s, and wandering around Sydney. But I also managed to sneak in an hour most mornings to work on my book. It‚Äôs amazing [how productive I can be with limited, focused work blocks](https://masilotti.com/solopreneur-on-vacation/).

I‚Äôm looking forward to diving back into work and finding my routine. I also need to start preparing for [my Rails World talk on Turbo Native](https://rubyonrails.org/world/agenda/day-2/6-joe-masilotti-se4ssion)!

Speaking of Turbo Native, there‚Äôs a lot of content again this month. Both libraries dropped their _beta_ tag and are now official v7.0.0 releases. I‚Äôve also included a link to two videos on getting started with Turbo Android.

Outside of native, we have a bunch of Hotwire tutorials and some big announcements.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

## üì£ Announcements

### [Rails World 2023 agenda](https://rubyonrails.org/world/agenda/day-1)

The Rails Foundation released the full agenda for the upcoming Rails World conference in October. There are 30 speakers split across two tracks. And like I said last month, the list is _impressive_.

I‚Äôm presenting [Just Enough Turbo Native to Be Dangerous](https://rubyonrails.org/world/agenda/day-2/6-joe-masilotti-se4ssion) at 1:30pm on the second day. If you‚Äôre going to the conference, I‚Äôd love to meet you ‚Äì come say hi!

### Turbo Native v7.0.0 releases - [iOS](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios/releases/tag/7.0.0) and [Android](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/releases/tag/7.0.0)

Yesterday Jay officially released version 7 of the two Turbo Native libraries. Both libraries were "presented in beta form" until today with a heavy disclaimer. Changes are now locked in and ongoing development will follow semantic versioning.

This, plus Strada‚Äôs planned release at Rails World, is getting me very excited for the future of Turbo Native.

### [Rails Hackathon 2023 winners](https://twitter.com/excid3/status/1687181744972136449)

by Chris Oliver [@excid3](https://twitter.com/excid3)

The second annual Rails Hackathon wrapped up earlier this month and the three winners were announced. Congratulations to the winning teams and [all 37 entries](https://railshackathon.com/events/2-supporting-rails/entries) submitted this year. There‚Äôs some outstanding work done on these projects, especially considering everything happened over a single weekend.

### [Stimulus v3.2.2 release](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus/releases/tag/v3.2.2)

The latest release of Stimulus has a slew of new features, bug fixes, and contributors. Highlights include more flexibility when binding to keyboard events, an additional observer for the Outlet API, and some error messages.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Tutorials

### [Building a real-time user page detector](https://afomera.dev/posts/2023-08-29-building-realtime-user-page-detector)

by Andrea Fomera [@afomera](https://twitter.com/afomera)

Learn how to use Turbo Streams to show an avatar for everyone who is currently visiting a page. Helpful in making it obvious there might be other folks working on the same thing you‚Äôre working on.

Andrea does a great job breaking each step down into concise, easy-to-follow steps. The code snippet on identifying a Devise user in a Turbo Stream is worth the read alone: `identified_by :current_user`.

### [You Don't Need Rails to Start Using Hotwire](https://www.akshaykhot.com/using-hotwire-without-rails/)

by Akshay Khot

This tutorial works through building a static site with a Turbo Frame all the way to a fully-baked Sinatra server with Turbo Streams. Akshay shows that you can slap Turbo (and Hotwire) on top of any web framework.

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as Turbo from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@hotwired/turbo';
</script>
```

### [Turbo Stream and personalised content](https://goodenough.us/blog/2023-08-02-til-turbo-stream-and-personalised-content/)

by James Adam

Here‚Äôs another approach to identifying the user in a Turbo Stream. Instead of grabbing the Devise cookie in JavaScript, the user‚Äôs information is embedded in the DOM. This, combined with a small Stimulus controller, enables some post-broadcast customization of Turbo Streams.

### [Dependent Dropdowns with Hotwire](https://greg.molnar.io/blog/rails-tricks-issue-17/)

by Greg Molnar [@GregMolnar](https://twitter.com/gregmolnar)

A quick tutorial on how to populate the contents of one dropdown based on the value of another - powered by server logic. Greg wires up a form that submits (automatically via Stimulus!) to set the values of the second dropdown. There‚Äôs also some tips on improving the UX, like hiding the button if JavaScript is enabled.

### [Responsive Navigation with Turbo](https://gorails.com/episodes/responsive-navigation-with-turbo?autoplay=1&ck_subscriber_id=1220776446)

by Chris Oliver [@excid3](https://twitter.com/excid3)

When a list of navigation links get too long you can render a dropdown on mobile. No matter how many links there are, the `<select>` tag will always take up the same amount of space.

Chris explains how to build this with an array of items so you don‚Äôt duplicate logic. And no Stimulus controller required, the page visit is inlined via `onchange`!

## üì± Turbo Native

### [App Store submission tips for Turbo Native apps](https://masilotti.com/turbo-native-app-store-tips/)

by Joe Masilotti¬†[@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Sometimes the hardest part about building a native app isn‚Äôt the coding. It‚Äôs getting approved in the App Store.

Here are the App Store Review Guidelines to watch out for when submitting your own Turbo Native app. I‚Äôve built this list up from helping dozens of businesses launch their iOS apps in the Apple App Store.

### Up and Running with Turbo Android - [part 1](https://williamkennedy.ninja/android,/turbo/2023/08/18/video-up-and-running-with-turbo-android/) and [part 2](https://williamkennedy.ninja/android,/turbo/2023/08/18/video-up-and-running-with-turbo-android-part-2/)

by William Kennedy¬†[@williamkennedy](https://twitter.com/_williamkennedy)

Follow along with William as he integrates Turbo Native into a brand new Android app. It‚Äôs like a counterpart to my [Turbo Native in 15 minutes video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83wOvrNtZX4). He adds a native tab bar in the first part and handles modals in the second.

I haven‚Äôt picked up Android in quite a while‚Ä¶ but this is getting me excited. I might have to fire up Android Studio again!

### [Turbo Native tabs](https://masilotti.com/turbo-native-tabs/)

by Joe Masilotti¬†[@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

A big benefit of Turbo Native is that you have full access to underlying iOS SDKs. So adding tabs is less about twisting the framework to do our bidding. And more¬†_wrapping_¬†our integration in some additional Swift code.

> P.S. It doesn‚Äôt happen often but I‚Äôm available to work with a new client in September. If you‚Äôre looking for help with your Turbo Native app then check out [my services page](https://masilotti.com/services/). I‚Äôd love to help!
