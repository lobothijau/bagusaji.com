Welcome back to the October edition of the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter!

Earlier this month I spoke at the Rails SaaS conference in Los Angeles. I met a ton of folks and was able to talk about a passion of mine: junior Rails developers. The conference was one of the most professional, engaging, and personal events I've ever been to.

A huge shout out and thank you to [Andrew Culver](https://twitter.com/andrewculver/) for organizing this! I'll be aggressively refreshing the page waiting for tickets to go on sale next year.

This month we have a guide to creating custom Turbo Stream actions, multiple pieces on using View Components in modern Rails apps, how to minify your Tailwind CSS in production, and more.

Also, I'm officially announcing **my Turbo Native workshop**! More info in the link below.

## üë©‚Äçüéì Tutorials

### [Turbo 7.2: A guide to Custom Turbo Stream Actions](https://marcoroth.dev/posts/guide-to-custom-turbo-stream-actions)

by Marco Roth [@marcoroth_](https://twitter.com/marcoroth_)

Turbo 7.2 introduced the ability to add new actions outside of the default 7. Marco walks through adding a simple action to log messages to the console. Then he builds out adding a toast message via custom action step-by-step. I especially like the custom helper with sane defaults so you can customize the toast as much (or as little) as you want.

### [Combined Mentions with ActionText](https://afomera.dev/posts/2022-10-11-combined-mentions-part-one)

by Andrea Fomera [@afomera](https://twitter.com/afomera)

Andrea walks through adding @ mention support to an ActionText field powered by Trix. She uses Tribute for the heavy lifting but there is still quite a bit of configuration to make it work _and_ look nice. The best part is that she starts from `rails new` so you can follow along without any existing code. Don't miss [part 2](https://afomera.dev/posts/2022-10-12-combined-mentions-part-two) covering saved replies and emojis. ü•≥

### [ViewComponent in the Wild: building modern Rails frontends](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/viewcomponent-in-the-wild-building-modern-rails-frontends)

by Evil Martians [@evilmartians](https://twitter.com/evilmartians)

The martians are at it again! This time Alexander and Travis explore effective ways of using View Components in growing Rails applications. Skip the beginning if you are familiar because there are some gems hidden towards the end. Like when and how to use component slots, atomic components, and some thoughts on querying.

### [Minify production CSS via cssnano](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com/pull/713)

by Andrew Mason [@andrewmcodes](https://twitter.com/andrewmcodes)

Andrew was kind enough to submit this PR to RailsDevs earlier this week. It reduced the production CSS output from 88kb to 67kb ‚Äì¬†over 20kb savings! And the change is contained to only two configuration files. I encourage anyone using Tailwind CSS in their Rails app to apply the same ‚Äì¬†it's [recommended by Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production).

### [The RailsDevs redesign begins](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1584935466838929414)

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

RailsDevs is getting a redesign! I worked with a designer to rework the visual branding including new colors. [Jacob Daddario](https://twitter.com/JacobDaddario) is kicking off the development work to apply the changes page-by-page. This Twitter thread documents our approach of a feature flag and request variants to avoid a long running branch. It's heavily inspired by [Ari Summer's article](https://codingdeliberately.com/releasing-a-redesign-using-feature-flags-and-rails-variants/) on the same.
