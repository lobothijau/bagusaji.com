Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! Big news from DHH Friday: the first official release of Hotwire 1.0 is live. That, plus a ton of Stimulus content, a few videos on Hotwire, and a link to a huge list of open source Hotwire apps - all in this edition.

## üéâ Hotwire 1.0

### [DHH announces Hotwire 1.0](https://world.hey.com/dhh/stimulus-3-turbo-7-hotwire-1-0-9d507133)

Official releases of [Stimulus 3](https://world.hey.com/hotwired/stimulus-3-c438d432) and [Turbo 7](https://world.hey.com/hotwired/turbo-7-0dd7a27f) make up Hotwire 1.0. Updates to Stimulus include the Values and CSS Classes API. 3.0 brings the ability to pass action method params. This means you can set an ‚Äúinteger‚Äù data item and Stimulus will automatically parse it - reducing the need for even more custom JavaScript.

## üìô Stimulus

### [Writing better StimulusJS controllers](https://boringrails.com/articles/better-stimulus-controllers/)

by Matt Swanson [@\_swanson](https://twitter.com/_swanson)

In summary, use general-purpose controllers as much as possible. First start off by wrapping an onClick function and then create ‚Äúbehaviors that you can use to quickly build out interactive sprinkles throughout your app.‚Äù Matt includes a few practical examples, including filtering a list of results.

### [Disable-With Using StimulusJS](https://dev.to/jacobdaddario/disable-with-using-stimulusjs-bco)

by Jacob Daddario [@JacobDaddario](https://twitter.com/JacobDaddario)

With Rails 7 (officially in beta!), Rails UJS is slowly starting to get phased out. And with that, automatically disabling forms on submit. Jacob walks through how to replicate this behavior with a single Stimulus controller and hints at some potential areas for improvement.

### [Dynamic Dialogs with Hotwire and Minimal Javascript](https://www.mikewilson.dev/posts/dynamic-dialogs-with-hotwire-and-minimal-javascript/)

by Mike Wilson [@mikew1o1](https://twitter.com/mikew1o1)

If you don‚Äôt want to reach for a third-party library _just_ for modals, this is a great tutorial on building them from scratch. It adds all the expected behaviors, including pressing ESC to close the modal. The only thing missing is proper accessibility markup.

## üìπ Videos

### [Dynamic Select Fields in Rails with Hotwire](https://gorails.com/episodes/dynamic-select-fields-with-rails-hotwire)

by Chris Oliver [@excid3](https://twitter.com/excid3)

A new GoRails video on how to dynamically update fields when a select box value is changed. In this example, when a country is selected a second select box‚Äôs options are populated with the country‚Äôs states.

### [Stimulus, Hotwire, Bootstrap 5, Rails 6 tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOiEAAac5Co)

by Phil Smy [@psmy](https://twitter.com/psmy)

Bootstrap - what a nice break from Tailwind CSS! In this episode of Real Life Rails, Phil walks through a fresh Rails 6 install and demonstrates how to display a duration via a Stimulus controller and Hotwire-powered dynamic content.

### [Hotwire Turbo Replacing Rails UJS](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/hotwire-turbo-replacing-rails-ujs)

by Dave Kimura [@kobaltz](https://twitter.com/kobaltz)

In this episode of Drifting Ruby, Dave dives into the functionality that we got with Rails UJS and what it looks like to reimplement these with Turbo and Stimulus, like confirmation dialogs.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire in action

### [List of Hotwire and ReactiveRails applications](https://github.com/asyraffff/Hotwire-in-action)

by Amirul Asyraf [@asyr0f](https://twitter.com/asyr0f)

A huge GitHub repository for all things Hotwire and ReactiveRails. The list includes open source applications, demo apps, tutorials, and even Hotwire in non-Rails environments.

### [Five Turbo Lessons I Learned the Hard Way](https://www.viget.com/articles/five-turbo-lessons-i-learned-the-hard-way/)

by David Eisinger [@deisinger](https://twitter.com/deisinger)

A few gotchas David has picked up when working on a client project with Turbo. Two that jump out to me are sending a 422 status code to re-render a form with errors and a way to trigger a Turbo form submission via JavaScript.
