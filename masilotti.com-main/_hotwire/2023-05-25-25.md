Welcome back to the ⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter!

I’ve been pretty busy since last month. I ran another Turbo Native workshop, took a few longboarding lessons, and got into not one, but *two*, trading card games. 😆

But I’m excited to dive back into more Turbo Native work. I’m working with two very different clients right now. I’m building an app from scratch for one and integrating new HealthKit APIs for the other. It’s invigorating to work in such different spaces at the same time.

Speaking of new and exciting, I recently started a second newsletter. It’s a [weekly email focusing on Turbo Native and me being a solopreneur]({% link _pages/newsletter.liquid %}). That is where I’ll be posting the more personal updates in the future. But don’t worry, *this* newsletter isn’t going anywhere!

So let’s dive into this month’s links. Highlights include the Rails World CFP announcement, how to write your own Rails generator, and *five* articles on Turbo Native - even Android gets some love this month.

## 📣  Announcements

### [Rails World Call for Papers now open](https://rubyonrails.org/2023/5/9/rails-world-call-for-papers-now-open)

Rails World is the first conference hosted by the Rails Foundation, taking place in Amsterdam on October 5 and 6. And the CFP is officially open! You have until June 16 to submit your talk or workshop.

## 👩‍🏫  Tutorials

### [Build a Memory Game with Rails, Stimulus JS, and Tailwind CSS](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/memory-game-rails-stimulusjs-tailwindcss)

by Marvin Kang [@kang_marvin](https://twitter.com/kang_marvin)

Fair warning, there is a lot of JavaScript in this tutorial.

Marvin walks through how to build a tile-matching game with Stimulus powered by a little Rails code to hold it all together. The most important takeaway I had from this is the clever use of [Outlets](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/outlets) to split up code among multiple controllers.

### [How to Create Custom Flash Types in Rails](https://www.akshaykhot.com/create-custom-flash-types-rails/)

by Akshay Khot

Did you know you can add custom flash types in Rails? Me neither!

Akshay walks us through how to use the API to create a “warning” flash and pass it directly to the redirect helper: `redirect_to root_path, warning: "Incomplete profiles"`. Read to the end to see *how* it is implemented under the hood in the Rails source code.

### [Turbo Frame Pages in Ruby on Rails 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwZDoz_Ya2k)

by Deanin [@Deaniocom](https://twitter.com/Deaniocom)

Anyone remember `.js.erb` files?

If you’re all in on Hotwire then you probably haven’t written one of those in a while. But we can apply the same concept to Turbo Streams. Deanin walks us through extracting some code into `.turbo_stream.erb` files to clean things up a bit and remove a little duplication.

### [Creating Custom Rails Generators](https://garrettdimon.com/journal/posts/creating-custom-rails-generators)

by Garrett Dimon [@garrettdimon](https://twitter.com/garrettdimon)

Ever run `bin/rails generate` or `bin/rails g` and wished the generated code was a little more *your* style? Join Garrett as he dives into Rails generators; learn how to customize the builtin ones and how to create your own.

Maybe I’ll finally get around to creating `bin/rails g turbo_native` now!

### [Conditionally style elements in Turbo Frames with Tailwind CSS](https://dev.to/spinal/conditionally-style-elements-in-turbo-frames-with-tailwind-css-1d74)

by Spinal CMS [@SpinalCms](https://twitter.com/SpinalCms)

A quick tutorial on how to add custom styling to elements when they are displayed in a Turbo Frame.

I love that how this approach uses a custom Tailwind CSS variant to target elements conditionally. For example, adding the `turbo-frame:hidden` class will hide the element when it is rendered in a Turbo Frame!

### [How to Get Up and Running With Turbo Android - Part 1](https://williamkennedy.ninja/android/2023/05/10/up-and-running-with-turbo-android-part-1/)

by William Kennedy [@williamkennedy](https://twitter.com/_williamkennedy)

> There are too few resources on getting up and running with Turbo Android. This post aims to rectify that.

Thank you William! Learn how to build the basic scaffolding of a Turbo Native Android app from scratch. I don’t know much Kotlin but was still able to follow along thanks to multiple screenshots of the Android Studio IDE.

### [How to Get up and Running with Turbo Android Part 2 - Feel More Native](https://williamkennedy.ninja/android/2023/05/19/turbo-android-part-2-feel-more-native/)

by William Kennedy [@williamkennedy](https://twitter.com/_williamkennedy)

Part 2 dives into adding a native screen powered by Jetpack Compose, Google’s modern UI tool, often compared to SwiftUI. I love that you can register fragments (screens) directly via turbo-android. I’d love if we could do the same for turbo-ios. 🤔

### [How to Get Up and Running With Turbo Android Part 3 - How to Access Native Android Features with the JavaScript Bridge](https://williamkennedy.ninja/business/2023/05/23/turbo-android-part-3-how-to-access-native-android-features-with-the-javascript-bridge/)

by William Kennedy [@williamkennedy](https://twitter.com/_williamkennedy)

Finally, part 3 follows up with how to call native Kotlin code from your web app. It uses the JavaScript bridge to read the user's contact book and display everyone's name in a web view. A great example of how Turbo Native can seamlessly bridge the hybrid gap.

### [Enhancing Turbo Native apps: How to hide web-rendered content]({% post_url 2023-05-02-hide-web-rendered-content-on-turbo-native-apps %})

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Sometimes shoving a web view in native chrome can look a little… off.

Here’s how I hide web-rendered content in Turbo Native apps to make them feel a little more native. All from the comfort of Ruby and HTML.

### [A Rails-like endpoint switcher for iOS apps]({% post_url 2023-05-12-rails-like-endpoint-switcher-for-ios-apps %})

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

iOS doesn’t have a `Rails.env.development?` equivalent - so let’s build one! This tutorial outlines how to make your iOS apps a little more *Railsy*. And can even be applied outside of Turbo Native.
