description: The junior developer edition - tips, tricks, and advice for getting hired and how seniors can empower them.
edition: Junior developer edition
---

Welcome back to the ~~August~~ *junior developer* edition of the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! This month is going to be a little different. I‚Äôm diving into something I‚Äôm passionate about: **junior Ruby on Rails developers**.

Why is it so hard for junior Rails developers to get their first job? And why do companies only seem to want to hire senior engineers? After doing a lot of interviewing I think I have some answers. I‚Äôm planning to share all of my learnings in my talk at [the Rails SasS Conference](https://railssaas.com) in October. (I hope to see you there!)

Until then, here are some tips, tricks, and advice for juniors to get hired. From positioning themselves better to getting interview feedback, there‚Äôs something for every stage of the hiring process.

Also, I‚Äôve included some **tips for senior developers** to help level up juniors. Whether they are already a coworker or an online friend, it‚Äôs our job to make sure they feel included and empowered.

Brian, a junior Rails developer at Planet Argon, breaks down the *process* of learning and why it‚Äôs important to have one. One tip that sticks out is to struggle before asking questions.

### [Rails is back isn‚Äôt enough](https://www.colby.so/posts/rails-is-back-isnt-enough)

by David Colby [@davidcolbyatx](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)

A bit meta, David uncovers a sad truth about the industry right now: not many companies are hiring junior Rails developers. He speculates that ‚Äúmany companies hiring Rails developers are hiring exclusively for senior level roles because companies using Rails tend to run quite lean.‚Äù But all is not lost ‚Äì¬†I‚Äôm on board with his advice for what we can do, *today*: invest in a pipeline of junior talent, give senior engineers time to coach and mentor, and slow down delivery cadence to give everyone room to breath.
