edition: January 2022 edition

Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! If you check out one thing from this edition I recommend the Remote Ruby interview with DHH on Rails 7. It's so inspiring to hear someone with this much passion for Rails talk about the framework.

I'm linking to Reddit for the first time üò± with a surprisingly healthy conversation on Hotwire vs. JavaScript front-end frameworks. There's also some great tutorials this month like how to build authentication from scratch, side-by-side code comparisons of Rails 6 vs. 7, replacing Rails UJS, and more.

Oh! I've been building [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com) in public for the past few months and I'd love if you could check it out. It's a reverse job board for Rails developers looking for their next gig. The best part? It's [open source](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com) and contributions are welcome!

### [Hotwire vs React/Vue/Alpine/Whatsoever](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/s19z3j/hotwire_vs_reactvuealpinewhatsoever/)

by Shino Kouda [@ShinoKouda](https://twitter.com/ShinoKouda)

A (surprisingly) healthy Reddit discussion on Hotwire vs. JavaScript front-end frameworks. Yes, it was posted on the Rails subreddit so there is a bit of bias, but it‚Äôs still a conversation worth checking out.

### [Turbo Laravel hits 1.0](https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-laravel/releases/tag/1.0.0)

by Tony Messias [@tonysmdev](https://twitter.com/tonysmdev)

The PHP port of Turbo for the Laravel framework has officially hit 1.0! I believe this is the first non-Rails implementation of anything Hotwire to reach this milestone.

### [David Heinemeier Hansson on Rails 7.0, Hotwire, and the future of Rails](https://remoteruby.transistor.fm/160)

by Remote Ruby [@remote_ruby](https://twitter.com/remote_ruby)

DHH joins the Remote Ruby crew again and gushes over the new Rails 7 features, especially the new answers on the front end. I find it inspiring to hear so much passion coming from someone who‚Äôs worked on an open source framework for this long. There‚Äôs also a [recording of the live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7V94uLtktk) available.

### [Migrating from Rails UJS to Hotwire: Data Method, Confirm, and Disable With](https://gorails.com/episodes/turbo-data-confirm-method-and-disable)

by Chris Oliver [@excid3](https://twitter.com/excid3)

I linked to a [similar tutorial](https://dev.to/thomasvanholder/how-to-migrate-rails-ujs-to-hotwire-turbo-hdh) on this last month, but if you are more of a visual learner than this video is for you. Chris covers confirmation dialogs, disabling form buttons on submit, and more.

## üìù Articles

### [Hotwire in the real world.](https://finnian.io/blog/hotwire-in-the-real-world/)

by Finnian Anderson [@developius](https://twitter.com/developius)

A deep dive into the architecture decisions, pitfalls, and wins of using Hotwire in non-trivial production application. I especially love the section on how important authorization is with Turbo Streams. Finnian recommends using [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) and covers how they are using it in their app.

## üéì Tutorials

### [Rails Authentication From Scratch](https://stevepolito.design/blog/rails-authentication-from-scratch/)

by Steve Polito [@stevepolitodsgn](https://twitter.com/stevepolitodsgn)

Did you know that the [Devise README](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise#starting-with-rails) recommends _not_ using Devise if you are building your first Rails application? In this ambitions project, Steve walks through every single step needed to roll your own secure authentication system. It‚Äôs already received a major update since 1.0 based on reader feedback.

### [New Rails 7 features, Before and After](https://gist.github.com/zakariaf/534ff8dfc3a807779133dc078114b969)

by Zakaria Fatahi [@zakaria_fatahi](https://twitter.com/zakaria_fatahi)

An exhaustive list of the changes you can take advantage of in Rails 7. What I love about this is everything has two code examples, which makes it easy to understand exactly where you need to make your own updates.

### [Breaking out of Turbo Frames](http://www.lewisyoul.co.uk/posts/breaking-out-of-turbo-frames)

by Lewis Youl [@lewisyoul](https://twitter.com/lewisyoul)

Clicking a Turbo Frame link can be set to render content inside their own frame or to navigate to a new page. Lewis covers how to wrap multiple links to do the same thing, and how to create an exception for just a few. Useful stuff if you have a lot of conditional logic on the navigation of your frames.

### [`button_to` conditionally respond with HTML or a Turbo Stream](https://blog.corsego.com/button-to-html-or-turbo_stream)

by Yaroslav Shmarov [@yarotheslav](https://twitter.com/yarotheslav)

I‚Äôve been using the `respond_to` block to fork controller rendering for a while. But what‚Äôs exciting about this tutorial is the `form:` option on `button_tag`. This lets us set the data type and ensure it is handled as a Turbo Stream.
