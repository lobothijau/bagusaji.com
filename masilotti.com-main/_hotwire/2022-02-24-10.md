edition: February 2022 edition

Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! If you check out one thing from this edition I recommend the Hotwire Example Template repository from Sean Doyle at thoughtbot. 19 (!) example Rails applications to play with all showcasing different Hotwire features in different git branches.

This month also links to a free (and open source!) course on building Rails apps with Turbo, a tutorial on how to create dynamic forms with Stimulus, and the annual Ruby on Rails survey from Planet Argon.

Don‚Äôt forget, the [RailsConf call for proposals (CFP)](https://cfp.rubycentral.org/events/railsconf-2022) submission deadline is due this weekend. My proposal is a talk on porting your Rails app to iOS with Turbo Native ‚Äì it‚Äôs my first RailsConf proposal so fingers crossed it gets accepted! ü§û

## üéì Tutorials

### [Learn modern Ruby on Rails with Hotwire](https://www.hotrails.dev/)

by Alexandre Ruban [@alexandre_ruban](https://twitter.com/alexandre_ruban)

A free and open source course on building apps with Turbo. Currently, 6 chapters are published which cover topics like simple CRUD controllers, real-time updates, and even a bit on Turbo Streams and security. Each chapter includes mockups on what you are building and example code to follow along.

### [The Stimulus Trigger Pattern](https://jose.omg.lol/posts/stimulus-trigger-pattern/)

by Jose Farias

A pragmatic and practical approach to a common problem with Hotwire: how do I submit a HTTP request after a Turbo Stream is rendered? Jose walks through how they built a shared space for two entities to communicate with each other, powered by Hotwire and some Liquid templating.

### [Dynamic forms with Stimulus](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/dynamic-forms-with-stimulus)

by Sean Doyle

Do you really _need_ those JavaScript sprinkles in your form? Maybe, but what about the folks that don‚Äôt have JavaScript enabled? This tutorial walks through progressively enhancing a standard HTML form. A Stimulus controller is added to dynamically hide certain inputs.

Ruby on Rails **+** StimulusReflex **+** Fly.io **-** hand-written JavaScript **=** ???

[Global Presence: an experiment](https://global-presence.fly.dev), is a POC using the latest Hotwire stack to do some pretty cool things. There‚Äôs a _global_ lightbulb that can be toggled by anyone visiting the page, a chat room of sorts, and a live-updated overview of users currently online.

### [Rails Survey 2022](https://planetargon.survey.fm/rails-survey-2022)

by Planet Argon [@planetargon](https://twitter.com/planetargon)

Planet Argon is back with the 2022 edition of their annual Ruby on Rails survey. Each year (since 2009!) they‚Äôve polled the community on their Rails workflow. As always, they plan to publish the results when the survey closes on April 30.

### [Action Cables Explained: The Ultimate Beginner Guide](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SN6vfLt1nEc)

by Ce Manalang

Ce walks through why Action Cable is so powerful and how it works in great detail. Starting with static websites, then working through Turbolinks (I haven‚Äôt heard that in a while!), touching on SPAs, and then finally example code for a full-stack Action Cable example.

### [Inline Editing with Turbo Frames in Rails](https://gorails.com/episodes/inline-editing-turbo-frames)

by GoRails [@GoRails](https://twitter.com/GoRails)

This episode of GoRails was created by Sean Doyle, Turbo source contributor and the creator of the [Hotwire Example Template repository](https://github.com/thoughtbot/hotwire-example-template) linked above. It covers how to implement inline editing in a reusable manner so you can inline edit any field across any model.

## üêô Open source

### [Hotwire Example Template](https://github.com/thoughtbot/hotwire-example-template/branches/active)

19 (and counting!) examples demoing a Hotwire feature with a fully functioning Rails app. Learn how to build an alert button, nested attributes, typeahead search, tooltips, live previews, and more. Each feature has its own branch on GitHub making it easy to see the changes at a glance.

### [RailsDevs](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com)

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Did you know that my reverse job board for Rails developers, [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com), is also open source? I manually review each PR with tips and ideas on how to improve the code. If you‚Äôre new to OSS or looking to make your first contribution I recommend you check out the repo and pick up an issue.
