Less than 3 weeks until Rails Conf! Do you have [your ticket](https://www.railsconf.org/register)? If you‚Äôre attending make sure to read up on the [COVID safety requirements](https://www.railsconf.org/covid) for the conference as you will need to get tested before attending.

Outside of the talks and workshops there are also a few unofficial events going on, including a volunteer event and a board game night. Check out [Mike Perham‚Äôs event page](https://www.mikeperham.com/events/) for more details.

I‚Äôm excited to meet so many online friends IRL for the first time. If you see me then come say hi! I look a lot like that photo above. üòÉ

### [Let‚Äôs recreate Notion in Ruby on Rails - Episode 1 - Creating Pages](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XWfyffFWbDI)

by Dr Nic [@drnic](https://twitter.com/drnic)

A _monster_ of a tutorial on recreating a very dynamic website, Notion. This is the first episode of many as Dr Nic walks through his development setup, getting the project set up, and the first steps towards building a version of the note taking app. Bonus, he uses [Jumpstart Pro](https://jumpstartrails.com) to skip a lot of scaffolding!

### [How to Add Filtering & Pagination to Your Data Tables With Hotwire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HURqvNJF4T0)

by Cezar Halmagean (Mix & Go) [@chalmagean](https://twitter.com/chalmagean)

Filtering and pagination via Hotwire has been covered a lot on this newsletter. But never before has it been consolidated to a 5 minute video.

### [Dynamically re-use & lazy-load pages using Hotwire](https://avohq.io/blog/dynamically-re-use-pages-with-hotwire)

by Avo HQ [@avo_hq](https://twitter.com/avo_hq)

The folks from Avo, an open source Rails admin gem, peel back the curtain and cover how they DRY up their Turbo Frame code. Instead of using (many) partials, they take advantage of a `BaseController` to handle resource-specific querying and rendering.

### [FREE - Learn Hotwire by Building a Forum](https://twitter.com/afomera/status/1512287468078264322)

by Andrea Fomera [@afomera](https://twitter.com/afomera)

Andrea made her 43 lesson course completely free! Learn how to progressively enhance your application building a real-time forum that goes beyond a simple Hotwire chat demo.

### [Testing scopes with Rails](https://dev.to/paramagicdev/testing-scopes-with-rails-4ho9)

by Konnor Rogers [@RogersKonnor](https://twitter.com/RogersKonnor)

Scopes can be hard to test because you are usually operating them against the entire test database. Konnor cleans things up and makes the tests much easier to read by introducing a tiny bit of dependency injection.

### [Optimizing Active Record queries](https://dev.to/kattyacuevas/optimizing-active-record-queries-4i84)

by Kattya Cuevas [@KattyaCuevas](https://twitter.com/KattyaCuevas)

Kattya works through a few polymorphic queries that get progressively more complex. Each one is benchmarked for speed and memory. There is also a [video recording of a talk on the same subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAsGgY2qz-8) from a recent WNB.rb meetup.

### [Ruby on Rails Flash Messages With Hotwire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1I7FLFuLlk)

by Cezar Halmagean (Mix & Go) [@chalmagean](https://twitter.com/chalmagean)

Another ~5 minute video this month from the Mix & Go channel, this time on flash messages. I knew about `flash.now` before, but `flash.keep` was new to me!

### [Turbocharged realtime search with Ruby on Rails 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uSenV1O1GA)

by Web-Crunch [@webcrunchblog](https://twitter.com/webcrunchblog)

If you like to follow along as someone live codes then this video is for you. It might be less polished than some other videos in this newsletter, but it has that ‚Äúreal‚Äù feel of someone figuring it out as they go. Personally, I find the speed of these kind of videos easier to follow.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Some personal updates

After many years of FactoryBot and RSpec I finally converted to test fixtures and minitest. Here's [my sane approach to test fixtures in Rails]({% post_url 2022-04-07-rails-test-fixtures %}).

Also, I was on the [Ruby on Rails podcast]({% post_url 2022-04-18-ruby-on-rails-podcast %})! We covered what it's like to build RailsDevs in public.
