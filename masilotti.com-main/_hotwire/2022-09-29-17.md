Welcome back to the September edition of the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter! Big news this month: Turbo v7.2.0 was released with ‚Äúthe largest upgrade to this cornerstone of Hotwire since we first released the framework‚Äù [according to DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1572955592821542912). Check out the first link below for more info and what I‚Äôm most excited about.

Speaking of being excited, I‚Äôm speaking at [The Rails SaaS Conference](https://railssaas.com) in LA next week! My talk is on hiring and working with junior Rails developers and what we can do to support them. If you‚Äôre attending then come say hi ‚Äì¬†I‚Äôd love to meet you in person.

Also, starting in October I'll be focusing 100% on [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com) and my upcoming Turbo Native workshop. I didn't forget about it! üôà I'll be sharing more updates on this newsletter next month and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti). Until then, what are _you_ hoping to learn from the workshop? Reply to this email to let me know.

## üì∞ News

### [Turbo v7.2.0 released](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/releases/tag/v7.2.0)

The latest version of Turbo was released with a whopping 23 new features and 41 bug fixes are included. I‚Äôm most excited about Custom Elements and Stream Action Types. Together, these enable a whole new ecosystem of third-party plugins and extensions that build on Turbo Streams to create custom actions, like [TurboReady](https://turboready.reflexready.com).

### [Rails Hackathon 2022 Winners](https://railshackathon.com/winners)

And the theme this year was Hotwire! 84 teams started and 25 of them [submitted entries](https://railshackathon.com/entries). There‚Äôs some impressive stuff here and it shows what can be done with Rails + Hotwire in just one weekend. Congratulations to all the teams that finished.

### [Thinking in Hotwire: Progressive Enhancement](https://boringrails.com/articles/thinking-in-hotwire-progressive-enhancement/)

by Matt Swanson [@\_swanson](https://twitter.com/_swanson)

Matt outlines his thought process when navigating through the Hotwire stack and when to reach for the next level of interaction (and complexity). Start with HTML-only CRUD, upgrade to full `<body>` replacements with Turbo Drive, swap out a Turbo Frame or two, make everything real-time with Action Cable, sprinkle in some Stimulus, and finally reach for Turbo Native. "The nice part about this approach is that you can build versions of features quickly, test and iterate based on feedback, and then layer on more real-time and interactive functionality as needed."

### [Building a modal form with Turbo Stream GET requests and custom stream actions](https://www.colby.so/posts/building-modal-forms-with-turbo-streams)

by David Colby [@davidcolbyatx](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)

Learn how to build a Turbo Stream-powered modal form without a single Turbo Frame in this lengthy tutorial. The first half goes from `rails new` to working modal and you could stop there. But if you want to learn about custom Turbo Stream actions then I recommend the second half. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be pretty fancy. It will also be completely unnecessary.‚Äù ü§ì

by William Kennedy [@\_williamkennedy](https://twitter.com/_williamkennedy)

Another Turbo Native tutorial! üéä Here, William outlines how to use a native tab bar to organize two different screens in a `turbo-ios` app. The first tab is a fully native screen and the second is a Turbo-powered web view. This approach is powerful because it enables high-fidelity experiences like the HEY or Basecamp mobile apps.

[Unfortunately named Ruby methods, a thread](https://twitter.com/tech_christine/status/1563272526532210688). ‚Äú`strftime`, is it stir fry time? Sad news, it‚Äôs not. But it will format a date according to a given string format.‚Äù üòÜ
