Welcome back to the ⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter! [RailsConf tickets](https://railsconf.org/register) went on sale this week for the in-person event scheduled for May 17-19. I bought my ticket, how about you? I’m excited to meet folks in person – I feel like I’ve connected with hundreds of new people over the past year online. It will be great to finally meet IRL.

Sadly, [my RailsConf proposal wasn’t accepted](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1507100497286610953?). So I’m going to run a remote workshop instead! It will cover porting your Rails app to iOS with Turbo Native and you won’t need any prior Swift experience. [Send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) if you’d like to attend and you’ll be the first to know when I open registration. 💪

## 🎓 Tutorials

### [User notifications with Rails, Noticed, and Hotwire](https://www.colby.so/posts/user-notifications-with-rails-noticed-and-hotwire)

by David Colby [@davidcolbyatx](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)

This tutorial starts with an empty Rails 7 project then adds on a Turbo Frame, creates a Noticed notification, wires up ActionCable, and finally subscribes to the stream via Hotwire. It’s everything you need to set up a live-updating notification drawer in your Rails app. 🔔

### [Toggling page content with Turbo Frames and Kredis](https://dev.to/phillipspc/toggling-page-content-with-turbo-frames-and-kredis-20no)

by Peter Phillips [@phillipspc](https://twitter.com/phillipspc)

The main goal of this tutorial is to remember the open/closed state of the toggle for the user. Persisting in Kredis keeps the state consistent even if the user signs in on a different device. [Kredis](https://github.com/rails/kredis), by the way, is a gem that makes interacting with Redis a bit easier.

### [Hotwire Handbook](https://philreynolds.dev/posts/2022/hotwire-handbook-part-1)

by Phil Reynolds [@PurpleRiver_Dev](https://twitter.com/PurpleRiver_Dev)

A living document on practical examples and how to accomplish them with Hotwire. So far, toggle buttons, content updates, and live counters are covered. Upcoming features include pagination, inline editing, and (what I’m looking forward to the most) tabbed content.

### [Upgrade Ruby from 2.7 to 3.0](https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/upgrades/upgrade-ruby-from-2.7-to-3.0.html)

by Cleiviane Costa [@cleicar_rb](https://twitter.com/cleicar_rb)

Wow, Ruby 3.0 was released in 2020! Follow along as Cleiviane walks through the Ruby upgrade process touching on deprecations, default gems, language changes, and more.

## 📹 Videos

### [Hotwire modals, with zero JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK16FeBfbxI)

by Pete Hawkins [@peteyhawkins](https://twitter.com/peteyhawkins)

Hotwire modal tutorials are all the rage these days! I know I’ve linked to some similar content before but I believe this is the first video explanation. Also, I love Pete’s fake data - I’d love to see “Fred Skywalker” in a Star Wars movie. 😆

### [How To Build a Powerful Search Form With Hotwire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MUEQVxUbm4)

by Mix & Go [@mixandgo](https://twitter.com/mixandgo)

A clean and easy to follow tutorial on a not-so-easy topic: search. There’s also a full GitHub repository with before/after branches if you want to copy/paste some code. Bonus: all of the equipment for recording the screencast is linked so you can set up your own studio.

## 🐙 Open source

### [Bullet Train goes open source](https://bullettrain.co)

by Andrew Culver [@andrewculver](https://twitter.com/andrewculver)

Bullet Train, a SaaS framework for Rails, just went open source. Previously a paid product, Bullet Train includes user authentication, teams/invitations, security, permissions, roles, Tailwind CSS… the list goes on! Check out [Andrew’s announcement](https://twitter.com/andrewculver/status/1507445981834461188) for more details. 🎉

### [Templatus (Hotwire edition)](https://github.com/ledermann/templatus-hotwire)

by Georg Ledermann [@ledermann](https://twitter.com/ledermann)

Continuing with the Rails template theme, Templatus was recently updated for Hotwire. While Bullet Train tackles features, this is more an opinionated development setup. For example, ViewComponent, Slim templating, Heroicons, esbuild, Docker, and puma-dev (to name a few) are all configured out of the box.

### [Bridgetown v1.0.0 released](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

by Jared White [@jaredcwhite](https://twitter.com/jaredcwhite)

Congratulations to Jared and the Bridgetown team on the first stable release! I’ve been following this project for a while and it’s exciting to see how much progress has been made over the past few months. Oh, and for those that don’t know, Bridgetown is like taking Jekyll and slapping Hotwire on top. Or as some refer to it: super-dee-dooper. 😁

## 💰 Paid courses

### [Hotwired ATS: Modern, full-stack Rails 7 development](https://gumroad.com/a/962864243/gcykx)

by David Colby [@davidcolbyatx](https://twitter.com/davidcolbyatx)

This book walks you through building an ATS, or Applicant Tracking System, from scratch with Hotwire, CableReady, and StimulusReflex. Some features include searching/filtering, dragging/dropping, slide over forms, real-time broadcasting, and inbound email processing. The audience is junior-level and up Rails developers.

### [Hotwire for Rails Developers](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/hotwire-rails?ref=masilotti)

by The Pragmatic Studio [@pragmaticstudio](https://twitter.com/pragmaticstudio)

I’ve been working through this video course as I Hotwire-ify a form on RailsDevs and it has been super helpful. It covers exactly how to use each facet of Hotwire, what's going on under the hood, and tons of common use cases. Also, you build an app that is all about catching fish!

## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Jobs

No job postings this week so I’m going to plug a project I’m working on!

### [The reverse job board for Rails developers &middot; RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com)

Traditional job boards make you do all the work. But on RailsDevs, you can skip the resumes, job descriptions, and recruiters. Add your profile to RailsDevs and find your next full-time job or freelance gig fast.
