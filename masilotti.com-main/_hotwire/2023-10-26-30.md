Welcome back to the ‚ö°Ô∏è Hotwire dev newsletter!

If you missed Rails World earlier this month, don‚Äôt fret. All the videos have been uploaded to YouTube with links to the slide decks. And Rails 7.1 was officially announced and quickly followed up by Rails 7.1.1. What a month October has been‚Ä¶

And to be honest, I‚Äôm still recovering from the conference. üòÖ¬†It was an absolute **blast** and awesome to finally meet a bunch of friends IRL for the first time. Shoutout to everyone who said hi and took a selfie.

After arriving back home in Portland I spent a lot of time working on my Turbo Native book. I think I‚Äôm closing in on what might be the first draft for iOS! And I‚Äôd love *your* help in making it the best book possible.

I‚Äôm opening up access to beta readers soon. These folks will get early access to the book (for a discounted price) in exchange for detailed feedback.

If this sounds interesting to you let me know. **Reply to this email letting me know _why_ you will be a good beta reader** and I‚Äôll add your name to the list.

## Announcements

### [Rails World talks live on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RZVdXyzwCw&list=PLHFP2OPUpCeY9IX3Ht727dwu5ZJ2BBbZP)

All 28 talks from the inaugural Rails World conference are on YouTube!

If you couldn‚Äôt make it definitely check out the playlist - everything on it is **top quality content**. Even the 1.5 minute introduction video! A huge shoutout to the speakers, the Rails Foundation, and Amanda for making this all possible. And don‚Äôt forget to check out [my talk on Turbo Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAq05KSra2g). üòä

### [Rails 7.1.0 and 7.1.1 released](https://rubyonrails.org/2023/10/5/Rails-7-1-0-has-been-released)

As I wrote about [last month]({% link _hotwire/2023-09-28-29.md %}), Rails 7.1 introduced a lot of new features. I‚Äôm most excited about the new authentication-related additions which make it easier than ever to roll your own authentication. All without third-party libraries! üí™¬†The [Rails 7.1.1 release](https://rubyonrails.org/2023/10/11/Rails-7-1-1-has-been-released) also quickly followed up with some minor improvements and bug fixes.

## Articles

### [Hotwire.io](http://Hotwire.io)

by Marco Roth [@marcoroth_](https://twitter.com/marcoroth_)

Marco launched a new website around the Hotwire ecosystem and it looks _great_! üòç¬†

Hotwire.io is a "a community-driven documentation and resource hub designed to promote the Hotwire ecosystem". It also includes information on tooling, helper libraries, use-cases, and more. Everything is open source - so if you can make an improvement please open a PR.

### [A happier happy path in Turbo with morphing](https://dev.37signals.com/a-happier-happy-path-in-turbo-with-morphing/)

by Jorge Manrubia [@jorgemanru](https://twitter.com/jorgemanru)

"Turbo 8 is coming with smoother page updates and simpler broadcasts." I am _very_ excited!

This is the article version of [Jorge‚Äôs Rails World talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m97UsXa6HFg), highlighting a _massive_ simplification to the default Turbo stream actions. In a nutshell, `redirect_to @resource` and you get a ton of magic _for free_. Also check out the [spiritual follow up](https://dev.37signals.com/exploring-server-side-diffing-in-turbo/) which dives into some behind-the-scenes during the development process.

### [The future of full-stack¬†Rails: Turbo¬†Morph¬†Drive](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/the-future-of-full-stack-rails-turbo-morph-drive)

by Vladimir Dementyev [@palkan_tula](https://twitter.com/palkan_tula)

Building on Jorge‚Äôs announcement of Turbo 8 above, the team at Evil Martians explores how far they can push morphing with a dynamic UI. And what they build is nothing short of impressive. I don‚Äôt want to spoil the fun ‚Äì¬†check out [the demo app](https://turbo-music-drive.fly.dev) (in Chrome!) to be amazed.

### [Hotwire Django Tutorial](https://tutorial.saashammer.com)

by Michael Yin [@michaelyinplus](https://twitter.com/michaelyinplus)

I love seeing non-Rails applications of Hotwire and this is no exception. This open source book helps Django developers learn¬†Hotwire. It walks through each piece of Turbo and wraps up with a bunch of real-world components like click to edit, a progress bar, bulk operations, and more.

I‚Äôd love for something like this for Rails. Who's building it? ü§î

## Turbo Native

### [üéß Turbo Native with the Turbo Native Guy, Joe Masilotti](https://share.transistor.fm/s/786ad92c)

by Emmanuel Hayford [@siaw23](https://twitter.com/siaw23)

I had the honor of chatting with Emmanuel at Rails World after giving my talk. We dove into all things, you guessed it, Turbo Native! I also dropped a few hints around my upcoming book and where I see Turbo Native in the future.

### [Turbo Navigator: Gearing up for the merge into turbo-ios]({% post_url 2023-10-12-turbo-navigator-upstream %})

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Turbo Navigator is a drop-in library that sits _on top_ of Turbo Native, reducing boilerplate by 100+ lines of code. I use it in every client project I work on. And we‚Äôre getting close to upstreaming it into turbo-ios!

### [strada-rails](https://github.com/lazaronixon/strada-rails)

by L√°zaro Nixon [@lazaronixon](https://twitter.com/lazaronixon)

L√°zaro Nixon, the creator of [Authentication Zero](https://github.com/lazaronixon/authentication-zero#authentication-zero) and [Turbo Native Initializer](https://github.com/lazaronixon/turbo-native-initializer), is working on a new gem in the Turbo Native space. This one pulls Strada into your Rails codebase, automatically detecting and using an import map or JavaScript bundler.
