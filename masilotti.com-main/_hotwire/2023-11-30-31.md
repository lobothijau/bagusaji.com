Welcome back to the ⚡️ Hotwire dev newsletter!

Earlier this week a new Turbo beta dropped with support for **morphing**. And wow does it look impressive! When applied, morphing enables high-fidelity interactions without a ton of custom Turbo Stream code. Check out the first section below for a demo video, code samples, and a link to the release on GitHub.

This edition also marks an important milestone. It’s the _tenth_ month with a section dedicated to Turbo Native. And I can’t help but get excited for all the developers getting started with hybrid app development. ☺️

And to celebrate, here’s a coupon code for $50 off my [Turbo Native crash course]({% link _pages/workshop.liquid %}) next week: `NEWSLETTER`. This live, 2-hour session is perfect for some hands-on experience working with Turbo Native and Turbo Navigator. It will also cover how to integrate Strada to create native components. I hope to see you there!

## Turbo 8

Creating high fidelity Rails apps just got a whole lot easier. Morphing, an upcoming feature in Turbo 8, enables seamless page updates without having to write custom Turbo Streams.

> The big new feature coming in Turbo 8 is morphing. We've put together an example app showing exactly the value it brings over using Turbo Streams, and just how simple it is to create a high-fidelity UI with no custom JS or Turbo hooks at all. - [DHH](https://x.com/dhh/status/1729289951525871830?s=20)

Jorge demos how morphing in Turbo 8 can dramatically simplify your codebase compared to Turbo Streams. No more `respond_to` blocks, no more re-rendering partials, no more custom broadcasting. Everything _just works_. 🤩

> Notice that stream actions aren't deprecated; they remain Turbo's most responsive mechanism. But they should become rarer, which is good because they are costly. The screencast shows why. - [Jorge Manrubia](https://twitter.com/jorgemanru/status/1729080765542248730?s=20)

There’s also an [accompanying article](https://dev.37signals.com/page-refreshes-with-morphing-demo/) with links to the code written in the demo.

Chris and Jason welcome Jorge to discuss the origin and inspiration for morphing from other frameworks and languages. They also touch on how ActiveRecord Encryption came to be.

> Forget everything you know about older versions of Turbo.

A bold claim from Brad but I like where his head's at. Turbo 8 and morphing simplifies the mental model of Hotwire apps to "a really smart page reloader". And that is definitely something I can get behind! Read on for how to install the beta and ideas on the refactoring you might be soon undertaking.

### [v8.0.0-beta1 release](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/releases/tag/v8.0.0-beta1)

Get your hands on the code and give it a spin! The maintainers are looking for feedback, so if you find a bug please open an issue on GitHub.

### [Building Basecamp project stacks with Hotwire](https://dev.37signals.com/building-basecamp-project-stacks-with-hotwire/)

by Nicklas Ramhöj Holtryd

Another great example of how much fidelity you can squeeze into a Rails app! And as always from the 37signals dev blog, there’s a _ton_ of code to digest.

> With 37 lines of Javascript and a few lines of Turbo Stream Ruby code we added a rich and responsive UX on top of an existing legacy Javascript drag-and-drop sorting system without adding any complexity to it.

by Joseph Izaguirre [@izaguirrejoe_](https://twitter.com/izaguirrejoe_)

Here’s a great way to make the built-in Rails flash message a little more _flashy_. 😉

Joseph uses Shoelace to style the elements but the core concept applies to Stimulus. A single controller converts the boring flash to a lovely toast message, animation included!

Follow along as Sid breaks down how the `<turbo-stream>` element works. There’s also a nice introduction to custom elements and how to use them.

### [Conditional styles for Turbo Native in TailwindCSS](https://world.hey.com/sevos/conditional-styles-for-turbo-native-in-tailwindcss-974c68bf)

by Artur Roszczyk [@sevos](https://twitter.com/sevos)

An easy way to build _native-feeling_ hybrid apps is to hide web-specific content, like `<h1>` tags. Instead of writing custom CSS for each element, you can create a Tailwind CSS _variant_. This enables classes like `turbo-native:hidden`, `turbo-native:bg-orange-300`, and even dynamic ones like `turbo-native:mb-[50]`!

Artur also has a follow up article on how to [do something similar with Strada components](https://world.hey.com/sevos/strada-bridged-components-with-tailwindcss-4a7133e4).

Donn is a native Android developer. He’s written multiple books, hosts a podcast, and has hundreds of hours of videos on the subject. So why is he promoting web view-powered hybrid apps?

> The reason is simple: **I believe the web will win.**

And I couldn’t agree more. Long live Turbo Native! 💪

### [How to use Strada with Turbo Navigator]({% post_url 2023-11-02-strada-and-turbo-navigator %})

by Joe Masilotti [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti)

Turbo Navigator is a small package that handles a bunch of boilerplate navigation in turbo-ios apps. But integrating it with Strada is a bit tricky and requires multiple steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide covering everything you need to get started.
