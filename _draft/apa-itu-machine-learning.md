Machine learning can be broadly defined as computational methods using experi-
ence to improve performance or to make accurate predictions. 

Since the success of a learning algorithm depends on the data used, machine learn-
ing is inherently related to data analysis and statistics.


## What problem can be applied with ML?

Text or document classification.
Natural language processing (NLP)
Speech processing applications. 
 object recognition, object identifi-
cation, face detection, Optical character recognition (OCR), content-based image
retrieval, or pose estimation.
fraud detection for credit card, telephone or in-
surance companies, network intrusion, learning to play games such as chess,
backgammon, or Go, unassisted control of vehicles such as robots or cars, medical
diagnosis, the design of recommendation systems, search engines, or information
extraction systems, are tackled using machine learning techniques.
